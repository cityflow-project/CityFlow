CityFlow is a multi-agent reinforcement learning environment for large-scale city traffic scenario. 

Checkout these features!

- A microscopic traffic simulator which simulates the behavior of each vehicle, providing highest level detail of traffic evolution.
- Supports flexible definitions for road network and traffic flow
- Provides friendly python interface for reinforcement learning
- **Fast!** Elaborately designed data structure and simulation algorithm with multithreading. Capable of simulating city-wide traffic. See the performance comparison with SUMO [#sumo]_.

    :alt: performance compared with SUMO

    Performance comparison between CityFlow with different number of threads (1, 2, 4, 8) and SUMO. From small 1x1 grid roadnet to city-level 30x30 roadnet. Even faster when you need to interact with the simulator through python API.
